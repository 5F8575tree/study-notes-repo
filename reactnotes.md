# REACT

React is a frontend library for building user interfaces. It is used for building web applications. If you just need a standard, static website, you can stick with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. If you need dynamic pages, you can use React.

## MERN Stack

- **MongoDB**, which is the application’s database
- **Express**, which handles the application’s backend
- **React**, which is used to build the front end
- **Node**, which is the runtime environment for the application

## Composition

We are used to using functions, and then using a single function that is composed of the other functions to return a value. In react, it works in the same way, but instead of writing functions to return some values, we compose the functions to **return UI elements.**
