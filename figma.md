# Figma

Figma is a free design program that allows you to design web and app projects. It is the fastest growing design tool (overtaking Adobe XD), and can be used directly in your browser. It is a good idea to download the program directly to your CPU, however.

## Figma versus XD versus Sketch

It is hard to say that any one of these design programs is better than the others. It comes down to preference. The output is the same.

At the end of the day, any clients you have will not care which program you use. It is far more important to you to get the design right than to get the program right.
