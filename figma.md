# Figma

Figma is a free design program that allows you to design web and app projects. It is the fastest growing design tool (overtaking Adobe XD), and can be used directly in your browser. It is a good idea to download the program directly to your CPU, however.

## Figma versus XD versus Sketch

It is hard to say that any one of these design programs is better than the others. It comes down to preference. The output is the same.

At the end of the day, any clients you have will not care which program you use. It is far more important to you to get the design right than to get the program right.

## Community

In the community tab you can see multiple plugins, templates, and other resources. To start with, you should learn the principles of web design before exploring the styles and fancy add-ons in the community tab.

## Basics

If you drag a rectangle onto the canvas it will bring up some options on the right-hand side. You can click the color box and choose a different color and then hit [esc] to exit the color picker.

In the home screen, double-click on a project to open it up for editing. Right-click on theproject to bring up further options, including delete (if you delete by accident got to Drafts > Deleted).

**NOTE** The projects are not saved on your local computer - everything is saved on the Cloud.

### Desktop Frame

The default size for the desktop frame is too small, however, so you should be sure to change it to **1920 x 1080**.

### Layers Panel Frames

When you move an item within a frame on the canvas, it automatically updates and is added 'within' the frame on the left-hand panel.

### Moving an item with shift+arrow keys

When you have an item selected, you can move it around in 10px increments by holding shift and tapping the arrow keys. If the item is within a frame, you can utilise the auto-align buttons on the right-hand panel.

Of course, the alignment tools work when you select more than one item, but it aligns the items _with one another_, rather than _with the frame_.

## Figma's Interface

The tools array at the top of a file's canvas is deceptively simple. You will essentially only use move, rectangle, frame, and text. You won't need pen as it is better to use icons from the web. The key is that when you click on a particular item on your canvas, it will bring up a corresponding menu on the right-hand panel to allow you to edit it.

## Design and Inspect Modes

It is incredibly useful that you can visually create your design, and then by clicking on inspect you can actually see the CSS code that can be copied and pasted into your CSS styles.

The 'play' icon at the top-right of the panel allows you to view the page without any distractions, and also allows for prototyping if you have made the design to be a 'working' prototype.

You also have the share button, which allows you to share with someone by sending a link via email or social media, etc. The beauty is that you can then continue to work on it and the link is updated as you make changes so a client can follow changes.

## Scale Tool

If you have an icon, for example, you will find that dragging a corner to resize it will actually make the lines run thinner (if you enlarge it) or thicker (if you shrink it). This is where the scale tool comes in.

With the scale tool you can simply drag a corner out (no need to hold shift) and the item will scale properly without distortion.

You can do this on several icon items at once by selecting them all.

**NOTE** After downloading the icon you wish to use, you can inspect it's layers in the layers panel and you can usually edit just one inner layer - for example, just the color of a particular line, etc.

**TOP TIP** With a downloaded batch of icons, you can often select them all together and then click on the color swatch and exchange that color across all of the items - really useful!

# Creating Buttons

In other design tools, you would usually create a button by drawing a rectangle, adding text, aligning them, and making it a grouped item.

However, in Figma **you want to use frames rather than rectangles!** This will make it much easier to organise your project and also to making your designs **responsive**.

Part of the reason is that frames are required to make your prototypes interactive, for example clicking a button to see where that button leads, etc.

You can of course nest frames, and in fact that is the natural way to work. Don't misunderstand that frames are like artboards in PhotoShop.

In short, don't use groups, use frames for everything you can!

Here's the perfect way to build a button in Figma:

1. Grab the text tool and type the text
2. Press shift + A
3. Rename the frame as something descriptive (e.g. 'submit-btn')
4. Click the fill color swatch and choose a color for both your text and your background (you will need to switch selections in the layers panel)
5. Round out the edges if you like with the radius tool on the right-hand panel (with the frame selected)
6. From the same panel, look for 'Auto Layout' and select the padding you want **NOTE** the small icon on the far right of the Auto Layout section allows you to adjust the padding on each side separately, so you can have wider padding on the right and left and narrowed padding on the top and bottom.
7. That same button allows you to center the text within the button, so that you can resize and keep the text centered.
8. If you decide to add an icon to the button, you can also use the Auto Layout tool of 'distance between' items.

Now you can move on to other styling if you wish, but you have your basic button to work with.

**NOTE** If you are starting a project, remember to use a Design Sheet to organise your project and keep the styling consistent throughout your pages.
