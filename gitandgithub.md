# Git and Github

## Introduction to Git

### What is Git?

    - A version control system (i.e. tracks and manages changes to files)
    - Think of it like making 'save points' on a video game, that you can go back to if you mess up
    - You can also branch off and then later create hybrids of the parts of the branches that you like best
    - Created by Linus Torvalds in 1991, passed over to Hamano Jun in 2005

### Git is NOT Github

    - Git runs on your local machine, it doesn't even require internet. After you download it, you can use it
    - GitHub is a website that hosts Git repositories and stores them in the Cloud for collaborations

## Installations & Basics

    - Git is a command line tool (although there are GUI versions)
    - The command-line is often faster, but the user interface is awful and the learning curve is steep
    - You MUST know the command-line method, but GUI is nice for many projects


# Shortcut Keys!

    - git --version
    - git config user.name (not setting a user name, but checking)
    - If you do want to subsequently change your email (or name) with: git config --global user.email "new@email.address"
    - You can use the up/down arrows to cycle through previous commands
    - ls (lists contents of current directory)
    - start . (opens up the current directory in the GUI)
    - ls FolderName (lists contents of a specific FolderName) (FolderName/innerFolder)
    - clear (clears the terminal)
    - pwd (prints the current working directory)
    - cd FolderName (changes the current working directory to FolderName)
    - cd .. (changes the current working directory to the parent directory)
    - touch FileName.[ext] (creates a new file called FileName.[ext] in your current directory(unless you write the path from the current directory)) *You can make multiple files are once
    - rm FileName (deletes the file called FileName) *WARNING: This will delete the file permanently
    - mkdir FolderName (creates a new directory called FolderName in your current directory)
    - rmdir FolderName (deletes the directory called FolderName)
    - rm -rf FolderName (deletes the directory called FolderName and all of its contents)
    - mv FileName FolderName (moves the file called FileName to the directory called FolderName)
    - *As you can see, folders and filenames are best with just one word*
    - ls -a (lists all files and folders in the current directory (including hidden/.git files))
    - ls -l (lists all files and folders in the current directory with their sizes)
    - ls -al (lists all files and folders in the current directory with their sizes and their permissions (including hidden/.git files))
